    (1) Set the environment variable 'MULUL'

            for bash users:
                $> MULUL=<oscar-basepath>/z/
                $> export MULUL


            for tcsh users:
                $> setenv  MULUL <oscar-basepath>/z/

                where <oscar-basepath> = the absolute path where the /z/ folder is located
                   


            ** note: don't forget the ending '/' character when setting the 'MULUL' variable



    (2) Side chain modeling 

            Example:
            $> oscar pdb_file

            Example:
            $> oscar -pdb data 

                    A file called 'data' in the running directory contains a list of pdb files.

            
           By default, a rigid rotamer model is used for side chain modeling (Bioinformatics 2011;
           27:2913-2914).
           In case a flexible rotamer modeled is preferred, please use the argument '-flexible'
           (JCC 2011,32:1680-1686). 
           Example:  $> oscar pdb_file  -flexible

           
           

     (3) Protein design 

      Example:  $> oscar -design pdb_file





     
    Notes
    (A)  oscar -h for more information.

    (B) In cases where only a small part of the protein is  modeled, set the 80th column of the 
        pdb file of the non-modeled part to 'X' as follows:

            ATOM      1  N   ALA A   1       7.672 -12.002  34.411                         X
     
    In protein design calculation, the residue type will not be changed but
    the side chain conformation will be modeled if the 'X' changes to 'Y'.
 

    (C) The polar hydrogen atoms should be added before calculation unless the
        whole protein is designed or modeled. 
         
        We recommend to use REDUCE (JMB 285:1735-47,1999) to add hydrogen atoms to the target protein.

    (D) The upper limit of the size of the  modeled protein is 3000 residues or 30000 atoms.
